# WordPress Plugin Template Demo
# This script demonstrates the enhanced plugin creation process

echo "🚀 WordPress Plugin Template Demo"
echo "=================================="
echo
echo "This demo shows how to use the enhanced WordPress Plugin Template"
echo "to create a modern, fully-featured WordPress plugin with:"
echo
echo "✅ PHP 8.1+ Support"
echo "✅ PHPUnit Testing"
echo "✅ WordPress Coding Standards"
echo "✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD"
echo "✅ Composer Dependencies"
echo "✅ VS Code Configuration"

echo "🔧 Running the creation script..."
echo "================================"
echo
echo "In a real scenario, you would run:"
echo "./create-plugin.sh"
echo
echo "And provide the following information:"
echo "- Plugin name: My Demo Plugin"
echo "- Destination folder: $DEMO_DIR"
echo "- Plugin description: A demo plugin created from the WordPress Plugin Template"
echo "- Author name: Demo Developer"
echo "- Author email: demo@example.com"
echo "- Include GitHub Actions: Yes"
echo "- Include PHPUnit tests: Yes"
echo "- Include PHPCS: Yes"
echo "- Include WordPress Feature API: Yes"
echo "- Initialize git repo: Yes"
echo

# Simulate what would happen (without actually running the interactive script)
echo "📋 What the script would do:"
echo "============================"
echo "1. ✅ Validate dependencies (git, composer, node, npm)"
echo "2. ✅ Copy template files to destination"
echo "3. ✅ Rename files with new plugin name"
echo "4. ✅ Update all class names and text domains"
echo "5. ✅ Generate composer.json with PHPUnit and PHPCS"
echo "6. ✅ Create phpcs.xml for WordPress standards"
echo "7. ✅ Set up PHPUnit configuration and sample tests"
echo "8. ✅ Generate GitHub Actions workflow"
echo "9. ✅ Install Composer dependencies"
echo "10. ✅ Initialize git repository"
